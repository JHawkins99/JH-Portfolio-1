    <h1>Jonny Hawkins</h1>
    <p>I am a Mechanical Engineer and Project Lead with experience in a variety of fields. From working to create respiratory devices to Fishing reels, to industrial pipe measuring devices and medical testing equipment. These projects have involved cross discipline collaboration with colleagues and external companies, which I have personally managed. Throughout my work I have gained skills in 3 major CAD packages (SiemensNX, Solidworks and Creo Parametric), for both 3D parts and assemblies, and also for drafting 2D drawings as well as knowledge of how to design plastic components for manufacture via injection moulding and for a variety of 3D printers. </p>
