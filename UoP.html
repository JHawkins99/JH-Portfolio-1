    <h1> University of Portsmouth - MENG Mechanical Engineering</h1>
    <h2>2012-2016</h2>
    <p>Achieved a merit in my Masters of Mechanical Engineering. My Masters project was developing production improvements for the wind turbine blades for MHI Vestas 100ft Wind Turbine, and my Bachelors dissertation was on the viability and use of energy storage technologies when coupled with Solar Energy.
        Whilst pursuing my Masters, my modules included:
        </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The use of a wide range of software packages such as Creo and Solidworks for CAD, Ansys for finite element analysis, and STAR CCM to model CFD.</li>
        <li>Knowledge of energy cycles such as Rankine and Joule Brayton</li>
        <li>Material science of polymers, metals and alloys; how each can be used optimally in different environments.</li>
        <li>Instilling a fundamental understanding of electrical and control systems.</li>
    </ul>
